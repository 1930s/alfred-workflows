Work with [Clear](http://impending.com/) lists from macOS.

To save a list from the iOS app, take a screenshot and tap the text. Save it as a text file or copy it to the clipboard.

To make a new list, either use the `Add as Clear list` File Action on a `.txt` or run `cadd` to get the copied list.

To view your lists run `clist`.

↵ drills further into the list, while ⌥↵ deletes it. When inside a list, ⌥↵ deletes the selected item, fn↵ asks you for an item to add above the selection and ⌃↵ to add below.
