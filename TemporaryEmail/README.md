Create temporary email inboxes via [Teleosaurs Mail](http://teleosaurs.xyz/).
 
When you have a supported browser (Safari, Webkit, Google Chrome, Google Chrome Canary, or Chromium) as your frontmost app, call `tmpmail`. The workflow will copy a temporary email address to your clipboard and open a background tab with the corresponding inbox. Give an argument to `tmpmail` if you want to use a specific name in the email.
