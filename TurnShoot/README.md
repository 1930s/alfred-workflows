Following the footsteps of [PingPong](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/PingPong), here’s now a two-player game for Alfred.

TurnShoot is a game where you try to react faster than your opponent. By default player 1 uses `q` and player 2 uses `p`, due to the position of both keys in a typical QWERTY keyboard. If you’d like to change these, see the bottom two nodes of the workflow and change the last letter of the `Keyword` input.
