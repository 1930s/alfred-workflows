Call `av` and a list of your top-level apps at `/Applications` and `/Applications/Utilities` will be shown with their version numbers. Action any of them and the version number will be copied to the clipboard.

If the app you want to check the version of is located anywhere else, you can find it and use the File Action on it for the same effect. This will also show the version as `Large Type`.
