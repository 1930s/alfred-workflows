Prevent your computer from going to sleep. Uses [`caffeinate`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/caffeinate.8.html) under the hood, so no third-party apps are required.

Type `coffee` to turn it on. Action it with ⌥ to also prevent display from going to sleep.

If you give it a value it’ll be active only for that amount of time. It defaults to minutes, but will also understand seconds and hours.

Run `coffee` again to manually turn it off.
