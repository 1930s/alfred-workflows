Clean clutter from URLs such as all sorts of [`utm_` variants](http://www.bytefive.com/blogs/understanding-utm_source-utm_medium-and-utm_campaign) and subdomains like `m.` for mobile sites.

Copy a link to your clipboard and call `lc` in Alfred. The clean link will both be copied to your clipboard and pasted to your frontmost app.
