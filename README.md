# Collection of Alfred Extension scripts

### Pinadd

### StrongPassword
Get a strong password from https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm directly to the clipboard.

### VideoDuration

#### License
I don’t care, do whatever you want with this. If you make any changes that could benefit any of the scripts, I’d certainly appreciate if you’d share them (perhaps I could incorporate them), but it’s not at all required.
