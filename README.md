# Collection of Alfred Extension scripts

### Pinadd
Takes arguments as tags, and adds your browser's (Safari or Chrome) frontmost tab as a pinboard bookmark.
(You need to add your Pinboard's API Token (get it at "https://pinboard.in/settings/password") on the line that says “token=""”)
(If you use Safari instead of Chrome, you need to change that option in the script by commenting the respective line. More instructions on the extension itself)
