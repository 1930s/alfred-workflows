Quickly open your current Chrome tab in incognito mode or a new Chrome instance with an empty profile — the latter means it’ll act just as if you hadn’t changed a single setting, which is particularly useful when something you changed (like preventing plugins from loading) is making it difficult to use a page.

Call it with `ic`, and it will open a new incognito window with your current tab. ⌘↩ will also close the tab in your current window. ⌥↩ to open the current tab in a new Chrome instance, and ⌃↩ to also close the tab in the current window.
