Call `macclean` and your keyboard will be temporarily locked (for `seconds_to_lock` in the Workflow Environment Variables) so you can clean them at will without messing what you’re doing.

The workflow will give you a timer of how many seconds are left to unlock and a notification when it’s done

You will be asked for your password when locking since this operation requires elevated privileges (which is a good thing). Do keep in mind that if something goes wrong in the process, you may (naturally) need to forcefully restart your machine. That is very unlikely and I’ve been using this for quite some time without any issues, but you should be aware of it.
