Call `macclean` and optionally (default is 50) a number of seconds. Your keyboard and trackpad will be temporarily locked so you can clean them at will without messing what you’re doing.

The workflow will confirm how many seconds the locking will last

And send another notification when it unlocks

You will be asked for your password when locking since this operation requires elevated privileges (which is a good thing). Do keep in mind that if something goes wrong in the process, you may (naturally) need to forcefully restart your machine. That is very unlikely and I’ve been using this for quite some time without any issues, but you should be aware of it.
