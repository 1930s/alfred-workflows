Call `bn {{website_adress}}` and the workflow will fetch the available logins for that website with the corresponding success rate.

If you had the login box selected prior to calling the workflow, hit ↩ and it’ll automatically type the username, hit ⇥ and type the password. If for any reason that did not work or you just want one of the details, use ⌃↩ or ⌥↩ to copy the username or password (respectively) to your clipboard.
