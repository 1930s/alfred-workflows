Call `bn` with a website address and the Workflow will fetch the available logins with the corresponding success rate.

If you had the login box selected prior to calling the Workflow, hit ↵ and it’ll automatically type the username, hit ⇥ and type the password. If for any reason that did not work or you just want one of the details, use ⌃↵ or ⌥↵ to copy the username or password (respectively) to your clipboard.
