Take screenshots with a keyboard shortcut and upload them directly to [imgur](https://imgur.com/). Will produce both a sound and a visual notification when done, and copy the resulting direct link to your clipboard.

A link to delete the image will also be produced and saved to `/tmp/webscreenshot_latest_upload_delete_url.txt`.

You may also upload an image (or pdf, since imgur also supports it as an upload, but converts it to png) by picking the `Upload Screenshot` `File Action`.

Each of those has a counterpart. The top ones leave the images untouched, while the bottom ones resample them before uploading. This is useful if you have a retina screen, as your images will otherwise appear twice the size when viewed on a browser.
