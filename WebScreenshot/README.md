Take screenshots with a keyboard shortcut and upload them directly to [imgur](https://imgur.com/). Will produce both a sound and a visual notification when done, and copy the resulting direct link to your clipboard.

You may also upload an image (or pdf — imgur also supports it as an upload but converts it to png) by picking the `Upload Screenshot` `File Action`.

Each of those has a counterpart. The top ones leave the images untouched, while the bottom ones resample them before uploading. This is useful if you have a retina screen, as your images will otherwise appear twice the size when viewed on a browser.

`recentscreenshots` will enumerate recently taken screenshots, ordered from the last. You can then open them in the browser to view (↩), delete (⌘↩), copy (⌥↩), or preview (⇧).
