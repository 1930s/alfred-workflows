An experiment to [answer a question](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2737-is-there-a-way-to-auto-refresh-results/).

Type `repeatrepeat` and the workflow will automatically start typing `.` (so it auto-runs again) repeatedly, once every two seconds. It’s a hack but it works well enough, with the only issue being it’ll still type `.` once after you dismiss it, which may lead to unpredictable results depending on what other apps you’re running.
