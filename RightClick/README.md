Even though a [native solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9171613/right-click-shortcut-for-mac-lion-os) exists, it suffers from a big flaw: it right-clicks where you cursor is, not what youâ€™re selecting. This workflow (or [gist](https://gist.github.com/vitorgalvao/6663126), if you prefer it as a Service) addresses that limitation.

Starting with Mavericks, it only works inside Finder windows, not on the Desktop.
